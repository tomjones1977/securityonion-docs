Managing Rules
==============

Updating Rules
--------------

To update your rules, run ``so-rule-update`` on your manager node:

::

  sudo so-rule-update
  
If you have a distributed deployment and you update the rules on your manager node, then those rules will automatically replicate from the manager node to your sensors within 15 minutes.  If you don't want to wait 15 minutes, you can force the sensors to update immediately by running the following command on your manager node:

::

  sudo salt \* state.highstate
